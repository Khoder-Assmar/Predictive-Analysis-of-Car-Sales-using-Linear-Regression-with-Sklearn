## Analyzing Used Car Prices with Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Linear Regression

### Project Overview
In this project, I developed a predictive model to analyze used car prices. The main goal was to clean and preprocess the dataset, explore key features, and build a linear regression model to understand the relationship between various car attributes and their prices.

### Introduction
Used car pricing is influenced by various factors such as the car's mileage, engine volume, and year of manufacture. This project aims to explore these factors, clean the dataset, and build a linear regression model to predict car prices based on these attributes.

### Data Collection
The dataset includes features like:
- Price
- Mileage
- Year
- Engine Volume (EngineV)
- Model (removed during preprocessing)

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved:
- Removing unnecessary columns (like 'Model')
- Handling missing values by dropping rows with missing data
- Removing outliers by capping the top 1% of values in 'Price', 'Mileage', and 'EngineV' columns

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA steps included:
- Plotting distributions of 'Price', 'Mileage', 'EngineV', and 'Year'
- Visualizing relationships between 'Price' and other features (e.g., 'Year', 'Mileage', 'EngineV') using scatter plots

### Feature Engineering
To better model the relationship between features and price, the 'Price' column was transformed using the logarithm to normalize its distribution, creating a new feature 'log_price'.

### Model Building
Linear regression was used to model the relationship between car attributes and 'log_price'. This involved:
- Importing necessary libraries (e.g., `LinearRegression` from sklearn)
- Preparing the data by removing the original 'Price' column after creating 'log_price'
- Visualizing the linear relationships between 'log_price' and the features

### Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated by assessing the visual linearity between features and 'log_price'. The scatter plots provided insights into how well the model might predict car prices based on the selected features.

### Results
The linear regression model helped identify the significant factors that affect used car prices. This analysis can guide pricing strategies in the used car market by focusing on attributes like car age, mileage, and engine volume.
